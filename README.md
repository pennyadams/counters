# counters
Analysing the effectiveness of certain strategies for a simple counters game.

## The game
There are two players. Each player starts with 25 counters. There are 5 rounds in which each player places down a certain amount of their counters. The player who places the most counters down wins the point for that round. Players must keep enough counters back to be able to play all 5 rounds. They cannot, for example, place a large amount of counters down for the first 3 rounds and then have none for the remaining 2. At least one counter must be put down for each round. Players do not have to use all their counters during the game. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.

## Strategies

This code analyses the effectiveness of a few different game strategies by simulating the game a few thousand times and showing the data on graphs.
